## Iterables

* Dictionaries and sets not sequences, but contain elements, like sequences 
* So need some way to find out which elements  
* Both sequences, sets and dictionaries are iterable
* Means we can step through the elements one after another 
* Easiest way to iterate over them is with a for-loop
