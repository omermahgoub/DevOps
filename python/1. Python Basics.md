## Setting Python up

* yum, brew, or apt-get install python3 python-pip pip install package_name
* System or local store of packages
* virtualenv - lets you keep separate stores of packages for different projects, helps avoid depency conflicts

### Python 3

* Python 3 language introduced in 2008, not strictly
* backwards compatible with Python 2 libraries
* The changes are small, but breaking
* Python 2 supported until 2020
* Some libraries not ported to Python 3 yet
* Careful, lots of code online is for Python 2
  * print "some thing %s" % var - Python 2 
  * print("some thing", var) - Python 3

### Python REPL

* REPL - Read Eval Print Loop •7+6
* `python3`
* `7+3`
* Interprets what we type and prints it until we quit Ctrl - D (EOF) to quit
* `Ctrl - D` (EOF) to quit

### Numerical operations

* Most of these are obvious (see Python reference for others)
* `7 - 17`
* `7 * 6`
* `7 / 2` ? Surprising? Huh
* `7 // 2` - integer division, divide and round down
* `-7 // 2` - // always rounds down
* `2 **5`
* `2 ** -5`
* `.5 ** 5`

* Most of these are obvious
* `33 % 5` - 33 modulo 5, remainder after dividing by 5 
> 33 % 5 = 33 - 5 * (33 // 5)

* `6 + 7 * 10` - not 130
* Not evaluated left to right, operators have different precedence 
> https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/expressions.html#operator-precedence

* If any doubt, or complex expression, use parentheses ()
* `(6+7)*10`
* Even when no doubt, parentheses make intent clear to other

### Variables

* Used to store literals and results of expressions
* `a = 7` - a a variable, 7 a literal
* `b=6`
* `a + b` - a + b an expression, result not stored anywhere
* `c=a+b` 
* `c`
* `c=c+1`
* `c`
* `c += 1`
* `c`

* Use print() function to print output
* `print(c)`
* `print("The value is", c, "and that"s a fact")` - adds spaces
* `d`
* None is a special symbol use to indicate variable does not refer to any value
* `p=None`
* `p`
* `print(p)`
* Note: variable names are case sensitive

### Floating point warning

* Floating point is one that"s not a whole number
* `a=10/9`
* `a`
* `b=0`
* `b += a` - repeat this 9 times
* `a*9`
* `b`
* Be careful when comparing them. Typically check numbers are close enough e.g. is 10 - b < 0.0001 
> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_epsilon

### Strings

* `"hello there"` - this is a string literal
* `"hello" + " " + "there"` - concatenate with +
* `"hip "* 2 + "hooray"`
* `name = "Tom Thumb"`
* `name[0]`
* `name[2:6]` - note character 6 not included
> dir(str) for more operations.

### Quoting

* How do we print the " character?
* Choice of quotes ' or ", if need to print one use the other
* `print("'")`
* `print('"')`
* If need to print both, escape with `\`
* Or use `"""`, also for multiline strings
* `print('He said "It\'s Tom\'s"')`
```
print("""He said "It's Tom's".
She replied, "It is in my hat\"""")
```
* One more way we'll get to later
