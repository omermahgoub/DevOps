# Scripting for System Administration

## Part 1 - Shell Scripting, Lecture 1

I'll try to cover as much details of shell scripting as possible. Although there's plenty of free information if you want to learn more by yourself. 

You'll see references to relevant content in the lecture footnotes.

**Also, for some quick reads see:** 
* http://linuxcommand.org
* http://matt.might.net/articles/basic-unix/

**And for mode detail and as a reference, read:**
* Advance Bash Scripting guide at http://www.tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/

> Node: 2e’ll use Ubuntu on this guide, but most command are applicable on all linux distributions

- There are several shell platform: `sh, ksh, bsh, csh, zsh`. They mostly do the same things, but differently 
- We’ll use bash - /bin/bash
